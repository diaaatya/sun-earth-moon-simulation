Here's a description and a `README.md` for your GitHub repository that you can use for your Sun-Earth-Moon simulation.

### Repository Description:

```
A Python simulation of the Sun-Earth-Moon system using Pygame. This project visualizes the gravitational relationship between the Sun, Earth, and Moon, with realistic orbital movements and trails. Ideal for those interested in Python, astronomy, and game development!

# 🌍 Sun-Earth-Moon Simulation 🌕

This is a Python simulation of the Sun-Earth-Moon system created using Pygame. The simulation demonstrates the orbital movements of Earth around the Sun and the Moon around the Earth. It also includes visual trails to track Earth's path.

## 🎮 Demo

Watch the simulation in action! The Earth orbits the Sun, and the Moon orbits the Earth with a circular trajectory.

## 🚀 Features
- **Realistic Orbital Motion**: Simulates gravitational forces between the Sun and Earth.
- **Moon Orbit**: The Moon orbits around the Earth relative to Earth's position.
- **Visual Trails**: See the path of Earth's movement as a trail behind the planet.
- **Simplified Physics**: Uses basic physics for simulation stability.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/diaaatya/sun-earth-moon-simulation.git
   cd sun-earth-moon-simulation
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   python planets.py
   ```

## 📄 Code Overview

- `planets.py`: Main file that contains the Pygame simulation code.
- **Gravitational Force**: Simplified gravitational formula for stability and real-time performance.
- **Trails**: The Earth’s position is recorded, and a trail is drawn as the planet moves.

## 🌟 Future Improvements
- Adding more planets to simulate the entire solar system.
- More realistic gravitational constants for accurate orbital speed.
