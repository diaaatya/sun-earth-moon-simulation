# 🌍 Sun-Earth-Moon Simulation 🌕

This is a Python simulation of the Sun-Earth-Moon system created using Pygame. The simulation demonstrates the orbital movements of Earth around the Sun and the Moon around the Earth. It also includes visual trails to track Earth's path.

## 🎮 Demo

Watch the simulation in action! The Earth orbits the Sun, and the Moon orbits the Earth with a circular trajectory.

## 🚀 Features
- **Realistic Orbital Motion**: Simulates gravitational forces between the Sun and Earth.
- **Moon Orbit**: The Moon orbits around the Earth relative to Earth's position.
- **Visual Trails**: See the path of Earth's movement as a trail behind the planet.
- **Simplified Physics**: Uses basic physics for simulation stability.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame
